What this is:
This, is ServerWorld, it is a minecraft/roblox hybrid that I have created. 
You can chat, fight, build, and explore (When 3D mode comes out very soon)

Origanally, This was supposed to be an entirely diffrent game but my partner (@Jaxamillon (May not be on github yet) ) and I Djbombtom44 (Midkid808)
did not have the time to work together to make it so i decided to make this as a placeholder and you get accustomed to game designing.

Hopefully by March, 2026 me and my boys will get cooking on the original ideas.
Oh, and the game name for that idea that we had will be VIRUS.

As for this gameplay itself its not too difficult and im too lazy to write it out right now so ill let you guys firgure it out but, it u need instuctions I got yall (Email me at rocketfortnit3@outlook.com or (After Feb 2026) Midkid808@outlook.com)
